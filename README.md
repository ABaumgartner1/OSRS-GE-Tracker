# OSRS-GE-Tracker
Python web scraper to track the value of all items of interest and put them in once place. This web scraper grabs the value of items from the mmorpg "Old School Runescape". I created this web scraper to be able to track the value of all of the valuable items that I have in the game, so I can quickly see if any of my items are losing or gaining value and I can keep track of my overall value in the game. This web scraper also allows me to keep track of other items of interest that I do not currently own, but wish to keep track of price changes. Keeping track of any items I want in one place makes it easier to see market trends in game and can help tremendously with "flipping" items for profit or deciding when to invest in more rare items.
